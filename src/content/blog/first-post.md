# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my new personal site, built entirely with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Why Astro?

When choosing a framework for a personal CV site, I wanted something that:

- Ships **zero JavaScript** by default
- Has excellent **static site generation**
- Supports **component-based architecture** without the overhead
- Makes **content-driven sites** easy with Markdown and content collections

Astro checked all those boxes.

## The Design

I went with a dark & techy aesthetic — think terminal vibes meets modern web design. The key design choices:

- **Color palette**: Deep dark backgrounds with electric green (`#39ff14`) accents
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for headings and code, Inter for body text
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-up reveals on scroll, terminal cursor blink
- **Texture**: Noise grain overlay and geometric grid lines for depth

## What's Next

I plan to write about software engineering, web development, and the tools I use daily. Stay tuned!
